# Supervised Learning
Supervised Learning is a kind of [[Machine Learning]] used to train [[Neural Networks]]. It requires a labelled dataset. The objective in supervised learning is for the model to predict the labels which correspond to each datapoint.

The labelling of the dataset usually needs to be done manually by humans, which is expensive and time-consuming.
