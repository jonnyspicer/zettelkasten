# Autocorrelation
Autocorrelation is a mathematical representation of the degree of similarity between a given time series and a lagged version of itself over successive time intervals.

E.g. if it's rainy today, it's more likely to be rainy tomorrow than if it was clear today.

An autocorrelation of +1 represents perfect positive correlation, while -1 represents perfect negative correlation.

A fundamental tool used in investment analysis.
