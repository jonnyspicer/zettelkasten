# Unsupervised Learning
Unsupervised Learning is a kind of [[Machine Learning]] used to train [[Neural Networks]].
Unlike [[Supervised Learning]], it uses an *unlabelled* dataset. The standard objective of the model is to try to predict or compress the dataset itself, which often allows further data to be generated that is similar to the training data.

GPT-3 and Dall-E are examples of impressive results generated using unsupervised learning.
