# Attribute Substitution
A psychological phenomenon whereby when faced with a difficult problem (attribute), one replaces it with an easy problem as a proxy. Once progress has been made on the easier problem, they consider that progress has been made on the harder problem, even if said progress is disproportional or nonexistent.

For example - climate change is hard, and I don't know how to solve it. But I do know that I can recycle the plastic I use, so by doing that I've done my bit to solve climate change.
