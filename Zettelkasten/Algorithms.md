# Algorithms
An algorithm is a set of instructions that takes an input, performs a repeatable computation, and produces an output. 

There are considered one of the cornerstones of [[Computer Science]] and are questions pertaining to them are frequently used by technology companies (particularly by FAANGMULA) in interviews.

Algorithms are often judged by their time and space complexity, in the form of [[Big O Notation]].

Traditional CS algorithms and [[Machine Learning]] algorithms are somewhat different due to the additional complexity in the latter. This is cutely illustrated by the following diagram taken from [S. Zayd Enam's blgo post on why machine learning is hard](https://ai.stanford.edu/~zayd/why-is-machine-learning-hard.html): ![[Pasted image 20220409155744.png]]
