# API
The mechanism through which one programme can talk to another.
They follow the pattern of a [[Client]] sending a request to a [[Server]], and the server sending a response back to the client.

They allow for developers to not have to worry about implementations, and know that if they send the correct request, they will receive data in return in a predictable format.

There are four common API protocols: [[SOAP]], [[XML-RPC]], [[JSON-RPC]] and [[Representational State Transfer (REST)]].
