# Python
Python is a [[Programming Language]] that uses [[Dynamic Typing]] and [[Strong Typing]]. It is an [[Object-Oriented]] language, as internally [everything in Python is an object,](https://docs.python.org/3/reference/datamodel.html) although other paradigms such as [[Functional Programming]] and [[Procedural Programming]] are supported. 

Variables in Python are `snake_case`, and constants usually in `SCREAMING_SNAKE_CASE`.
Constants are typically defined on a [[Module]] or global level, and while technically *can* be changed, they are unintended to do so.
