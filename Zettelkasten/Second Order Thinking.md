# Second Order Thinking
Considering the outcome of some action past whatever its initial consequences might be. 

First order thinking looks like "I'm hungry so I'm going to eat a chocolate bar". Second order thinking looks like "I'm hungry, so I could consider eating a chocolate bar. But then I'll have consumed something nutritional porous, I'll spike my glucose levels and thus have an energy dip later, and I'm training for an ultramarathon. Plus, I'll feel better about myself and my choices if I have something healthier, so instead I'm going to have an apple".

Second order thinking is necessarily significantly more complex and complicated than first order thinking.

Second order thinking is also necessary to make good decisions. In life, things are rarely simple enough for first order thinking to suffice.
