# P-Hacking (AKA Data Dredging)
When researchers only report results that have a statistically significant p-value (usually < .05, representing a less than 5% chance of the results being due to randomness alone) and do not report results with larger p-values.

Particularly prevalent in psychology and medicine. This is usually done because incentives for researchers are misaligned, and they are rewarded for producing meaningful/interesting/novel results, rather than for doing robust science.
