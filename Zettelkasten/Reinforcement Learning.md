# Reinforcement Learning
Reinforcement Learning is a kind of [[Machine Learning]] used to train [[Neural Networks]].
There is no fixed dataset, but rather an environment in which the model takes actions and receives observations - essentially as in a video game. After each action, the agent receives a reward (akin to a score in a vdieo game), which is used to reinforce desired behaviour and reduce undesired behaviour. Since actions can have long-lasting consequences, the key difficulty in reinforcement learning is determining which actions are responsible for which rewards - a problem known as [[Credit Assignment]].

AlphaGo and AlphaStar are examples of impressive results generated using reinforcement learning.
