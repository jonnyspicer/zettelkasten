# Artificial Intelligence
Artificial intelligence is primarily a field adjacent to computer science and statistics (and to some extent neuroscience and anthropology) concerned with machines' ability to solve complex problems.

"An artificial intelligence" refers to a machine that is capable of solving some kind of complex problem. "An artifical *general* intelligence" refers to a machine that is capable of solving most complex problems at least as well as humans.
