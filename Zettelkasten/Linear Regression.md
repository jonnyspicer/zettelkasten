# Linear Regression
>Linear regression assumes that the relationship between two variables, _x_ and _y_, can be modeled by a straight line:
>
   β<sub>0</sub>+β<sub>1</sub>x

If using *x* to predict *y*, then *x* is known as the explanatory or **predictor** variable, and *y* is known as the response.

Regression seeks to examine two things:
1. Does a set of predictor variables do a good job in predicting an outcome variable?
2. Which variables in particular are signficant predictors of the outcome variable, and what is the magnitude and direction of the impact?

Once a line has been fitted to a particular model, the leftover variation in the data between said line and a specific datum is known as a *residual*. One goal in picking the right linear model is for these residuals to be as small as possible.

> **Correlation**, which always takes values between -1 and 1, describes the strength of the linear relationship between two variables. We denote the correlation by _R_.
