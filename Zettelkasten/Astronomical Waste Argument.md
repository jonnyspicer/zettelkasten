# Astronomical Waste Argument
An argument used by philosopher Nick Bostrom to illustrate the value of [[Longtermism]].
At its core, the argument states that if humanity does not achieve wild technological advancements (eg colonizing other planets and galaxies or AGI leading to unparalleled productivity) then we will have missed out on the creation of an enormous number of new, happy lives, as well as dramatically increasing the quality of lives that would've existed counterfactually, we'd have missed out on so much moral value that it would be an "astronomical waste". This is closely linked to the idea of ensuring humanity reaches its potential as discussed by Toby Ord et al.
