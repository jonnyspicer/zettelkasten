# Symbolic AI
A paradigm popular in the early days of AI, around the 1950s. Symbolic AI focuses on representing problems using statements in formal languages (eg programming languages) and searches for solutions by manipulating these representations according to fixed rules. Deep Blue was an example of this - it had rules that described where the pieces currently where and where they could move, and then searched through positions which satisfied both these sets of rules, to devastating effect.

Symbolic AI turned out to be difficult to generalise, as few real-world examples can be reduced down into formal languages. Hence, since the 1990s, the dominant paradigm in AI has instead been [[Machine Learning]].
